# Crypto-Bridge

I must credit Rodrigo for this project. I learned how to build this bridge from his [repo](https://github.com/burgossrodrigo/token_bridge).

This project showcases a how a typical crypto bridge works.

## What I learned in this project

Well, these are the few things I learned:

1. I am now more familiar with syntax, so I noticed I flowed quite well. Didn't check StackExchange that much.

2. I used different interfaces in this project. Mixed up the params of a function in an interface when I was calling it in the main contract. Took me about 30 minutes to figure and fix.

3. I built this project without relying on any external library or standard, especially ERC. Built from scratch.
